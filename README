== Start_Here

This is a testbed for Rails 3.1 and Mongoid, and is meant to be a personal reference implementation for a modern rails stack using:

- rails 3.1
- mongoid
- omniauth
- haml
- sass
- compass
- configatron
- rspec/cucumber/capybara

The app uses omniauth to connect to services like LinkedIn, Twitter, StackOverflow, Quora, and others, and aggregate some of the information it finds.

Initial setup based on Daniel Kehoe's excellent tutorial:
https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-omniauth/wiki/Tutorial

Layout largely based on Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate:

Sass mixins from Zass:
